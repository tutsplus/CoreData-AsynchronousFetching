### Tuts+ Tutorial: iOS 8: Core Data and Asynchronous Fetching

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

As of iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, it's possible to asynchronously fetch data. In this tutorial, we'll take a closer look at how to implement asynchronous fetching and in what situations your application can benefit from this new API.
